## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(sna)
library(igraph)
directdata <- read.table("directed.txt")
indirectdata <- read.table("undirected.txt")
graph1 <- graph_from_data_frame(indirectdata, directed = FALSE, vertices = NULL)
plot(graph1)

g_full <- make_full_graph(8, directed = FALSE)
plot(g_full)
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
